"A fun Rock, Paper, Scissors game! Download and play!"

I originally used this to practise python but then I was unsatisfied with this terminal game, so I wanted to make it into a web app, looked for some frontend designs on Codepen, found something similar, integrated with ClaudeAI, and it helped me make this little project came into fruitation.

Although it's a small app, I am quite proud of my very first project that includes HTML, CSS, JS, Python, as well as JSON. The fact that I made it into a mini desktop app and was able to distribute it is also very exhilarating.

Feel free to download, give it a try, and also feel free to comment any suggestions.
